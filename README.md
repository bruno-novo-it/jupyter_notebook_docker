Jupyter - iPython Notebooks
===========================

This is a Jupyter installation using docker alpine and some packages.

Requirements
------------

You will need to have `curl`, `docker` and `git` installed.

 Install
-------

Go to the folder you want to start the notebook:

```
$ cd <FOLDER_YOU_WANT>
```

Execute the installer pasting the following line on your terminal:

```
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bruno-novo-it/jupyter_notebook_docker/master/run_jupyter_notebook.sh | bash
```

Then, open your browser on `http://localhost:8888`.

You will see the files you have inside that folder.
